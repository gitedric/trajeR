\title{Odds of Correct Classification}
\usage{
OCC(sol, Y, A)
}
\arguments{
\item{sol}{Trajectory's object. An object of type trajectory.}

\item{Y}{Matrix. A matrix containing the variables in the model.}

\item{A}{Matrix. A matrix containing the time variable data.}
}
\value{
A vector of real. The Odds of Correct Classification.
}
\description{
Calculate Odds of Correct Classification. The Odds of Correct Classification for 
group k (OCCj) is the ratio between the odds of a correct 
classification into group j on the basis of the posterior probability rule and 
the odds of correct assignment based on random assignments with the probability 
of assignment to group j is done with $pi_{ik}$, the probability estimate by 
the model.

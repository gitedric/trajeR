Title: Group Based Modeling Trajectory
Description: Estimation of group-based trajectory models, including finite mixture models for longitudinal data, 
    supporting censored normal, zero-inflated Poisson, logit, and beta distributions, 
    using expectation-maximization and quasi-Newton methods, with tools for model selection, 
    diagnostics, and visualization of latent trajectory groups,
